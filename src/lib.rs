//! # üóÇÔ∏è `kollect`
//!
//! A set of collections optimized for game development usecases.
//!
//! # Provided Collections
//!
//! - [`LinearMap`], useful when you want a collection that behaves as a key-value map but you will only ever have
//!   up to a few tens of elements. For small numbers of elements and small size of contained key/value types, this
//!   will likely be faster and take up less memory than other map types, but its random access operations have O(len)
//!   complexity rather than O(1) as with hash-based maps.
//! - [`UnorderedMap`], useful when you want a general-purpose key-value map, you plan to do random access
//!   lookup by key more frequently than iteration of the contained elements, and you don't care about order of
//!   those elements.
//! - [`OrderedMap`], useful when you want a key-value map including a set order of element pairs, or when
//!   you plan to iterate over the contained elements more frequently than you do random access lookup by key.
//!
//! - [`LinearSet`], useful in the same situation as [`LinearMap`] but when you're operating on a set of values rather
//!   than a map.
//! - [`UnorderedSet`], useful when you want set-like operations, will do more random access than iteration,
//!   and will fill with a medium to high number of elements.
//! - [`OrderedSet`], useful when you want set-like operations and need a defined order of elements, or you
//!   plan to iterate over the contained elements more frequently than do random access lookup on them.
//!
//! # Usage table
//!
//! Number of elements | Access pattern | Need defined order | Choose
//! ---|---|---|---
//! Less than ~128 | Any | Any | [`LinearMap`]/[`LinearSet`]
//! More than ~128 | More Random Access | No | [`UnorderedMap`]/[`UnorderedSet`]
//! More than ~128 | More Iteration | No | [`OrderedMap`]/[`OrderedSet`]
//! More than ~128 | Any | Yes | [`OrderedMap`]/[`OrderedSet`]
//!
//! # Specialized hashers
//!
//! The [`specialized_hashers`] module contains some helpful specialized hasher variants that can speed up your
//! hash-based collections when you have knowledge about the keys/elements being used.
//!
//! For example, if your keys in a map or set are small and primitive-integer-only, then you may want to use a
//! [`BuildPrimitiveHasher`]-based alias of one of the hash-based collections ([`UnorderedPrimitiveMap`], etc.).
//!
//! Alternatively, if you are keying a map or creating a collection of elements which are themselves already a
//! hash value (or which otherwise qualify as [`NoHashable`]), then you may want to use one of the [`BuildNoHashHasher`]-based
//! aliases of one of the hash-based collections ([`UnorderedNoHashMap`], etc.).
//!
//! # `serde_as_seq` for maps
//!
//! When the `serde` feature is enabled, there are adapters usable with `#[serde(with = "path::to::module")]` at `kollect::some_map::serde_as_seq`
//! which will serialize and deserialize those maps as sequences of `(k, v)` pair elements rather than as native serde Maps.
//! This is useful with JSON because JSON maps can only have string keys, and if you try to serialize a map to JSON which has a key type
//! that can't be serialized as a string, the serde JSON impl will simply panic at runtime. Using `serde_as_seq` will circumvent this issue
//! and allow you to serialize a wider range of key types.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! `kollect` uses a set of [feature flags] to optionally reduce the number of dependencies.
//!
//! The following optional features are available:
//!
//! Name | Description | Default?
//! ---|---|---
//! `speedy` | Enables [`speedy`] support for most types | No
//! `serde` | Enables [`serde`] support for most types | No
//!
